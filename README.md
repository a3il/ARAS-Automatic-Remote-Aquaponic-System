ARAS |Automatic Remote Aquaponic System
ARAS is an IOT cloud-based remote aquaponic system called that makes it possible to produce sustainably and economically at all hours and in all seasons. It is an RTC system with a synchronized clock for service routines and sensors like BMP, peltier, and temperature to measure the soil's moisture, temperature, and humidity as well as the atmosphere's overall humidity. The system can then be adjusted by changing the fans or adding irrigation to maintain a constant equilibrium for the plan to grow optimally. A business plan, a roadmap, a cost analysis, and an advantage are all available. The IOT APP that we've put in place controls the cloud. This project was implemented on a hackathon competetion and has won 1st prize(IEEE Eve Hack 2023) Credits to Nidhin Chandran,Nandu,Joyal Kusoms.
